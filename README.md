An Introduction to Functional Programming.

A presentation in LaTeX beamer. You need pdflatex to generate the pdf.

If you have rake installed you can generate the pdf by typing "rake" in the top-level directory of this repo.

I used BasicTex, a subset of the MacTex distribution, and then installed the following packages seperately:

$ sudo easy_install Pygments
$ sudo tlmgr install minted
$ sudo tlmgr install ifplatform
